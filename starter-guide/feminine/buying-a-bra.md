If you medically transition, you will almost certainly eventually need to buy a bra. Like with buying any gender aligning clothing, this can be quite intimidating at first, with the added complexity of sizing yourself and finding a bra that fits you. A bra will provide support through everyday life and can provide additional volume to your breasts through padding.

## Measuring

[A Bra that Fits Calculator](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php)

Bras have two main figures that describe them, band size and cup size. The band size measures the circumference of the chest directly below the breasts, while cup size is the circumference measured across the most prominent part of the bust (breasts). The cup size is usually calculated as an absolute difference between band and cup circumference. If you are buying a bra online, keep in mind that, while most countries use letters to designate cup size, and numbers to designate band size (i.e. 30A), most countries have their own way of calculating these figures.

If you are attempting to measure for yourself, you should use a soft measuring tape, usually sold as a sewing or garment tape. We recommend using the [guide and calculator on A Bra that Fits](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php) for the most accurate results. Many other calculators struggle with the sometimes unusual sizes that trans-femmes have and produce incorrect results. It is a good idea to get a professional bra fitting once you're a little further into your transition.

# What to Get

> If you are using a Sports Bra to bind, please read our [safety advice](/starter-guide/masculine/binding.html#safety) first.

A sports bra is an excellent option for people who's breasts have not yet developed enough to fit a more standard bra. Most come with padding, which can be especially affirming at this early stage. Likewise, buying a snug one can act as a temporary binder for use around people who you are not yet out too.

Later on, you may want to consider getting a more standard bra. When properly fitted, they tend to be more comfortable, supportive and practical. [urBasics provide a great guide aimed a transgender women](https://urbasics.ca/pages/the-trans-woman-s-ultimate-guide-to-bras).
