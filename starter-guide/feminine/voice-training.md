Since *feminizing hormones do not alter a person's voice*, people who experienced a male puberty who want a more typically "feminine" voice must do so either behaviourally or [surgically](/starter-guide/medical/surgery.html#vocal-surgery). Voice training usually aims to simultaneously raise pitch, increase [resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance), and take on a more "feminine" affect. This page collects both free online resources, as well as clinics specializing in trans voice training.
