If you choose to medically transition - or present as trans to your doctor - it is incredibly important to find a supportive and preferrably knowledgeable doctor. If you have a local trans support or advocacy group in your city it is likely they have a list of recommended clinics or providers.

## Australia

[TransHub maintains a list of doctors who have self identified as trans positive](https://www.transhub.org.au/doctor-list).

## United Kingdon

[TransActual maintains a list of private clinics that specialize in trans healthcare](https://transactual.org.uk/medical-transition/private-care/). Many trans people in Britain access their hormones through [GenderGP](https://www.gendergp.com/) specifically, but they have recently fallen into controversy.

## United States

[TransHealthProject maintains a list of private clinics that specialize in trans healthcare](https://transhealthproject.org/resources/trans-health-care-providers/). Likewise, [WPATH provides a directory searchable by state](https://www.wpath.org/provider/search?provider_directory_search_form%5Baddress%5D%5Bcountry%5D=US&provider_directory_search_form%5Baddress%5D%5Bstate%5D=&provider_directory_search_form%5Baddress%5D%5Bcity%5D=&provider_directory_search_form%5BfirstName%5D=&provider_directory_search_form%5BlastName%5D=&provider_directory_search_form%5Bspecialty%5D=)
