People undertaking a feminizing transition after experiencing a male puberty often experience dysphoria as a result of their facial hair. For this various techniques to cover or permanently/semi-permanently remove hair can be an important part of transitioning.

## Temporary
### Shaving

Shaving is the most common and effective form of temporary facial hair removal. Instructions can be found in detail on our shaving page.

### Epilation

{: .warning }
Do not use an epilator on your face or genital region. While appropriate on most of the body, these areas are far more sensitive and use can lead to scarring or injury.

Epilation involves a device - named an "epilator" - that uses mechanical tweezers to rapidly pull hair out from the root. This can be done at home, with devices costing as low as USD$15, although care should be taken as the process can be painful and can cause minor injury. Because, unlike shaving, it pulls the hair from deeper below the skin, the results of epilation last for longer.

### Chemical Hair Removal

{: .important-warning }
> Do not use chemical hair removers such as Nair on your face or genital region. While appropriate on most of the body, these areas are far more sensitive and use can lead to scarring or injury. 
>
> Seriously, **do not use Nair there**.

Chemical hair removers, such as Nair, are available commercially and can remove hair from the body for up to a month. They can cause less irritation than epilation or even shaving, but a small patch of skin should first be tested for allergic reaction. These removers can, when misused, cause first, second, or even third degree chemical burns to the applied area.

## Semi-Permanent and Permanent
### Laser
Laser Hair Removal is one of the most accessible and affordable forms of **semi-permanent** hair removal. Beard area-only sessions are often in the range of USD$50 per session, and you would expect to undertake anywhere between 10-20 sessions depending on density and hair type.

Laser Hair Removal is generally **ineffective** for people with darker skin or hair that is light or red. Most clinics are able to assess your specific skin and hair type for viability.

### Electrolysis
Electrolysis is the most effective hair removal technique and it's effects are **permanent**. The procedure is costed by the hour, usually at around USD$70-USD$150, and involves the treatment of individual hair follicles. Although effective, it can be timely and expensive to remove all facial hair with this technique.

Electrolysis is effective on all skin and hair types.
