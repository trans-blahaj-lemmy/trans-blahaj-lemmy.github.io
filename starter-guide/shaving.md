Shaving can be an important and affirming part of grooming for many people. This guide covers three methods: electric razors, cartridge razors, and safety razors. It will walk you through the basics of each method, suggest pricing, and offer tips to help avoid irritation and achieve a smooth shave.

## Electric Razor
Electric razors are a great starting point if you're new to shaving, as they are simple to use, minimize nicks, and allow for a dry shave. They work well for stubble and can be used on the face, neck, and body. An electric razor won’t give as close a shave as other methods, but is simpler and more convenient than the other methods listed here. For femmes specifically, it can be convenient to carry around a lipstick razor in your car or purse for quick shaves during the day.

### Technique
To shave with an electric razor, move the razor in small circles or along the grain of your hair.

### Cost
An electric razor can cost as little as USD$20, but a mid-range option in the range of USD$50 to USD$100 will likely give better results. The Braun Series 3 is a popular choice for this.

## Cartridge Razor
Cartridge razors consist of a handle and replaceable head which typically has three or more blades. These are widely available and are a great middle-ground between electric and safety razors, offering a reasonably close shave with a simpler technique than a safety razor. However, cartridge razors are the most expensive shaving method.

### Technique
Apply shaving cream or gel to soften the skin. Shave with the grain of your hair to avoid irritation. Be sure to move the razor only in straight strokes—never sideways across the face—as this can lead to serious cuts. Rinse the razor between strokes to prevent clogging.

### Cost
A starter handle and blade cartridge set costs between USD$10 and USD$20. Replacement cartridges (often in packs of 4-8) range from USD$10 to USD$30.

## Safety Razor

{: .warning }
Prioritize harm minimization. While we recommend this technique for trans-femmes, be mindful that safety razors use double edged blades. If having these blades at home could trigger or induce self-harm, it may be best to avoid this option.

Safety razors, which consist of a handle and a repleceable bare double edge blade, offers the closest shave while costing significantly less than their cartridge counterpart. If you can put in the practice, they are **the best option for trans-femmes**.

### Technique
Wet the skin and apply a high-quality shaving cream or gel. Shave gently, with the razor at a 30 degree angle from the skin, in the direction of hair growth. Avoid pressing down, as the weight of the razor provides sufficient pressure. Rinse after each pass. Shaving against the grain of the skin is liable to cause razor burn.

It can take a lot of practice to master this shaving technique, especially if you have more feminine skin. Start slowly and always watching in the mirror.

### Cost
An entry-level safety razor costs around USD$30, with more premium models reaching up to $80. Razor blades are sold in packs of 10-100 for USD$10-USD$20, making them cost-effective over time. [Astra Double Edge Blades](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B001QY8QXM) are a popular choice for blades. Any handle with adjustable blade exposure levels will be a good option to start with.
