Binding, commonly used within transgender and gender-nonconforming communities, is the process of compressing the chest to create a flatter appearance. It provides a way to affirm one's gender identity and alleviate dysphoria. While binding can be highly beneficial for many, it’s crucial to practice it safely to avoid adverse health effects.

## Methods
### Sports Bras
Wearing a snug sports bra is one of the most accessible and safest forms of binding, providing it is not so tight that it restricts breathing or blood flow.

### Binders
Binders are items of clothing specially made for binding, typically taking the form of a tank top or singlet. When buying a binder, it is important to properly measure your body and check manufacturer specifications.

Because they are designed to be tight, it can take some practice to put on and take of a binder. The first time you try one, it is best to have a friend around to help if you need it. To put it on, alternately try stepping into the binder or pulling down the binder, trying not to let the binder roll up on itself. Do the reverse to take it off, again, preferably with a friend present to help.

## Safety
The following safety guide is taken from the [TransHub website](https://www.transhub.org.au/binding):
* Limit binding to 8 hours a day. Beyond that is placing unfair working conditions on your body. If you’re a binding beginner, don’t start at 8 hours, go for 1-2 hours to start with and then take it off for at least an hour. See how you feel, and check in with any potential pain or discomfort.
* Take regular breaks. Go somewhere private and take your binder off or roll it down. Take deep breaths and let those lungs and ribs have a good stretch. Wave your arms around, sing or whatever it takes to get everything loose and moving.
* Listen to your body. If binding is causing you pain, stop binding. Your body is telling you there is a reason that binding is not working right now. We don’t always like listening but your body is your friend!
* Duct tape is not good for binding, it’s not safe and is not kind to nipples. Fabric bandages are designed for compressing things like sprained ankles and can get way too tight if you use them for binding. Leave the bandages in the First Aid kit they are designed for. 
* Don’t bind when exercising. This is when you need to breathe even more than usual. There are other options that are designed to allow for more movement, like a sports crop tops. It’s ok to wear to an over-sized shirt.
* Summer time binding. Things can get really hot under there, causing you to overheat and possibly cause skin irritation. When the weather gets warmer it’s extra important to take care of yourself. There are ways to cool off, including baby powder, wearing a t-shirt underneath or just taking longer breaks. The swim binder could come in handy here!
* Bodies change. You may be growing, on testosterone and changing shape, or changing in other ways. So keep up with your body and make sure you change binder size when you need to.
