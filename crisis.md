If you or someone you know needs immediate support, some local resources are listed here:

## United States
The following US-based resources (from [GLAAD](https://glaad.org/transgender/resources/)) are available:

* [The Trevor Projectâ€˜s](http://www.thetrevorproject.org/) 24/7/365 Lifeline at [866-4-U-TREVOR (866-488-7386)](tel:+18664887386) or [TrevorChat](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/), their online instant messaging option, or [TrevorText](sms:678678), a text-based support option. If you are looking for peer support, you can visit [TrevorSpace](https://www.trevorspace.org/) from anywhere in the world.
* [Trans Lifeline](http://www.translifeline.org/) at [877-565-8860](tel:+18775658860)

We do not consider the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline a safe resource for the trans community due to their history of involving local law enforcement without the caller's consent, which can result in indefinite detainment.

## Australia

* [Lifeline](https://www.lifeline.org.au) is available 24/7 at [13 11 14](tel:131114), or to text at [0477 13 11 14](tel:+61477131114).
* QLife offers a range of support from 3PM-12AM everyday at [1800 184 527](tel:1800184527), or through [webchat](https://m2.icarol.com/ConsumerRegistration.aspx?org=61795&pid=253&cc=en-US).
