Reach out for support or mutual aid if you need it. This community is available to all who need to discuss issues, get something off their chest, or find support. /c/trans allow mutual aid requests with prior approval from the moderation team, so reach out to us. 

[The best mutual aid and support is local](/local-community). We encourage everyone to research trans advocacy groups around them, local queer facebook pages, and keep connected with their community.
