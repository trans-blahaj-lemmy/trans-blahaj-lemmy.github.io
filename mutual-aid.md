# Mutual Aid

{% include_relative _callouts/crisis.md %}

Reach out for support or mutual aid if you need it. This community is available to all who need to discuss issues, get something off their chest, or find support. We allow mutual aid requests with prior approval from the moderation team, so reach out to us. In addition, the following communities and resources are available for mutual aid or support:

* [Blahaj has a community Matrix](https://lemmy.blahaj.zone/post/15256176) free for anyone to join.
* The [Trans Housing Network Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#thn-chat:matrix.org) helps connect unhoused people, or people in unsafe housing, to those able to provide temporary shelter
* [Mutual Aid Hub](https://www.mutualaidhub.org/) has a list of mutual aid resources across the United States
* The aforementioned [TrevorSpace](https://www.trevorspace.org/) offers peer support globally
* If there are any other resources we've missed, please [direct message me on Matrix @emily:mtrx.nz](matrix:@emily:mtrx.nz) or leave a comment

The best mutual aid and support is local. We encourage everyone to research trans advocacy groups around them, local queer facebook pages, and keep connected with their community.
